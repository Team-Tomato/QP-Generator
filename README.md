We always prefer Slack, yet we decided to try WhatsApp for communication to reduce the gap between the mentee and mentor. If you have read our [wiki page](https://github.com/Team-Tomato/QP-Generator/wiki) and decided to contribute to the project, please join the [Whatsapp chat](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FPC7s89jrtr44ZvCHY9CJM)
